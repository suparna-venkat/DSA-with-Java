# Arrays-in-JAVA
This folder contains my practice programs on arrays in Java.
I’m using it to understand basic array operations, logic building, and common DSA problems like searching, reversing, frequency counting, and subarrays.
The goal is consistency and clarity, not just solving—actually understanding how arrays work.
